Interfacing with a soil sensor, using the ARM mbed microcontroller. It facilitates the communication between a microcontroller, in this case, the NUCLEO-L476RG, and the soil sensor via UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication protocol. The primary objective is to read various environmental parameters such as temperature, electrical conductivity (EC) of water and soil, and volumetric water content (VWC) from the soil sensor and print them to the console for further analysis or application-specific processing.

The writeRegister assembles a data array comprising the register's address and the intended value, transmitting this data via UART to the sensor for configuration. The readRegister function is tasked with retrieving data from a predetermined register of the soil sensor. It initiates communication by transmitting the register's address to the sensor through UART, patiently awaiting the reception of the associated data. Once received, this data is then relayed back to the calling function for further processing. The retrieved data is then formatted and printed to the console for visualization or further processing.

The measurement is processed by writing values to the SNSR_CTRL register of the soil sensor. Entering an infinite loop where it continuously checks the state of the soil sensor by reading the SNSR_STATE register. If the sensor indicates that it has completed measuring (state == 0x01), the measurement data is read and printed to the console using the readMeasurementData function. Otherwise, if the sensor is still measuring or has not started measuring yet (state == 0x00), a corresponding message is printed to indicate the ongoing measurement process.

Throughout the loop, a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) is introduced using the ThisThread::sleep_for function to prevent excessive polling of the sensor and conserve system resources. This ensures that the sensor state is checked at regular intervals without overwhelming the microcontroller.
