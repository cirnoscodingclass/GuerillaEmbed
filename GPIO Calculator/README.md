This code uses several functions and declarations to facilitate interactions with both a 16x2 character LCD and a 4x4 matrix keypad. It initializes the GPIO pins for the LCD and keypad, allowing for communication and input detection.

The `key_checker` function scans through each row of the keypad, sequentially activating one row at a time while monitoring the corresponding column inputs. By determining the row and column of the pressed key, it maps the pressed key to its corresponding character in the `key_map` array. 

`operation` function prompts the user to select a mathematical operation using the keypad. It continuously monitors the keypad inputs until the user inputs a valid operation, which is then executed using externally defined assembly functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

`convert` and `InputVal` to convert strings to integers and to facilitate user input, respectively. These functions enable the user to input numerical values via the keypad, converting the entered string to an integer for further computation.

Once both numbers and an operation are provided, the code computes the result and displays it on the LCD screen, resetting the input process for subsequent calculations.
